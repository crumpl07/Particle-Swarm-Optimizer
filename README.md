# Particle-Swarm-Optimizer
An attempt at the particle swarm optimization algorithm:

My goal from completeing this project is to have a better grasp on vectors and and coding C++ in Visual Studio.

In completing this project I have gained more knowledge about OO programing and the vector data type. I also completed my main goal of learning more about vectors and coding in C++.
